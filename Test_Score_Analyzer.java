 *  Problem:
    Mr. White needs to analyze studentsâ€™ chemistry test performance. He 
    needs a program to display a name and let him enter the test score. 
    Then it should compute and display the average. Finally, it should 
    give a report with names, scores, and deviation from the 
    average.
